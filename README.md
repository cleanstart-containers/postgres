### Vulnerability Disclaimer

CleanStart offers Docker images that include third-party open-source libraries and packages maintained by independent contributors. While CleanStart maintains these images and applies industry-standard security practices, it cannot guarantee the security or integrity of upstream components beyond its control.

Users acknowledge and agree that open-source software may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities or introduce new risks through updates. CleanStart shall not be liable for security issues originating from third-party libraries, including but not limited to zero-day exploits, supply chain attacks, or contributor-introduced risks.

Security remains a shared responsibility: CleanStart provides updated images and guidance where possible, while users are responsible for evaluating deployments and implementing appropriate controls.
